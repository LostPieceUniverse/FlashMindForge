# FlashMindForge

Welcome to the FlashMindForge Flashcard Program! This ongoing project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to study using flashcards, right from your console.

### Configuration and Storage

FlashMindForge utilizes a configuration file to define certain attributes, including the location of decks and cards.
By default, the configuration file is located at:<br>
`[home_dir]/.config/flashmindforge`
Within the configuration file, you can specify the directory where decks are stored, which defaults to:<br>
`[home_dir]/.local/FlashMindForge/`

## Disclamer

I am a Rust noob and have no idea what I am doing. :frog: <br>
This will be worked on sporadically in my freetime. That means no frequent commits. I dont even know if this will ever be finished.

## Overview

This project is developed in Rust and serves as both a learning tool for the language Rust and a practical flashcard program.<br>
The current version is a console application, but future updates may include a TUI for improved user experience.<br>

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete flashcards.
- View flashcards in a randomized or sequential order.
- Has a config to define the deck directory
- more incomming...

## Plans 
 Those plans are in no order and just ideas I want to implement in the future.

- Making it a TUI application (certaing attributes would be defined in the config)
- Get the code to a point where its actually good and efficient...
